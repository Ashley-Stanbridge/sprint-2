Reflections on Scrum. 
 
 
Scrum seems really neat. I always just kind of assumed this was more or less how it worked in the industry anyway. is this not how lager companies work? 
 
 
in my (very limmited) experance i have found the process of producing a new "product" really daunting because of the amount of work that needs to be done. i can imagiane breaking it down into more managable sections of work would save so much stress and time. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reflections on paring. 
 
 
 
 
Pairing is one of the things i am most excited about i think. in the short time i have been teaching myself web development i have encountered on several occasions situations where something isn't working and i spend hours trying to workout what's wrong only to find it's the most obvious thing that i have only missed because i have seen it in my code enough times that it seems right. i feel like having a second set of eyes would make this way less of an issue.  
 
 
I have also found myself trying to complete something only to get distracted by a new idea or get really fixated on something that isn't important, so having someone to keep things on track would be awesome. 
 
 
also sitting and coding for hours on end is so strenuous I think swapping back and forth would let your hands rest while keeping your mind focused.
