Although all of these principles are important, I feel the reduction of mental effort by the user is key to a well rounded user experience. i have found myself on the receiving end of this mistake many times as a user, and know the frustration of having to spend more time than necessary completing any given task.  
  
  
by extension, the provision of an adequate navigation system is of huge importance as it enables the users to easily see where they are, where they have been and where they might go next.  
  
  
  
  
  
Are there any principles which you disagree or feel are unimportant or less important?  
  
  
  
  
No. i believe all of the listed ideas are important to the full user experience.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Are there any which surprised you?  
  
  
  
  
Yes, i have never thought of making sure that error messages don't blame the user and instead explain what has happened on the server end and offering a potential solution for the user.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ROI of UCD. 
 
 
What supprised you? 
 
 
 
 
I am really shocked but not necessarily surprised by the amount of money/potential revenue lost as a result of poor UCD. i am however surprised by the amount of poorly designed websites and software still being made in a time where people surely understand it's importance and the way it can reflect on an otherwise excellent business. 
 

 Does this change your view of software and web development? 
 
 
 No it does not. However it does reaffirm my feeling towards clean functional design and simple yet effective user interface.
